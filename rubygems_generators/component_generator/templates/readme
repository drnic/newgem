How to create an Application Generator
======================================

1. DONE - Create a new RubyGem (using newgem or hoe) or you can use an existing one.
2. DONE - Run the generator: script/generate application_generator foobar
3. Using the generated test class, assert what directories, files, classes etc should
   be generated.
4. Add these files into the app_genearators/foobar/templates folder. Your files can use
   ERb (that is, <%= ... %>).
5. Specify who the files in /templates are copied/templated at generation time within app_generators/foobar/foobar_generators.rb 's #manifest method.
   Use m.file for files to copy over.
   Use m.template for files containing ERb. Create attr_reader accessors for any variables your
   templates need access to.
6. Run unit tests.
7. If your application generator uses other generators (m.dependency "gen-name", [arg1, arg2], :option1 => 'value')
   then you must add this into the generated bin/foobar file.
   For example, if you wanted to use a rubygems and/or merb generator, then replace the use_application_sources! 
   call in bin/foobar:

      RubiGen::Base.use_application_sources! :rubygems, :merb

   Without this, RubiGen will not be able to find your dependent generators.
8. Update your Manifest.txt with the new files (if you are using Hoe; using newgem? it uses Hoe; so you need to do this)
9. Build and install your RubyGem locally. Run: rake install_gem
10. Test your foobar application to ensure that it connects to the generator correctly and generates files.
11. Done.
